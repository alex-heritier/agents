# Example User Configuration for Agent Providers
#
# This file demonstrates how to extend or override the default provider configuration.
# Place this file at ~/.config/agents/providers.yaml (or $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/agents/providers.yaml)
#
# The configuration in this file will be merged with the default configuration,
# allowing you to:
# - Add new custom agent providers
# - Override default file paths
# - Customize slash command conventions

  # Example: Override Claude configuration
  # claude:
  #   name: "claude"
  #   display_name: "Claude Code (Custom)"
  #   guideline:
  #     file: "CLAUDE.md"
  #     dir: ""
  #     source: "AGENTS.md"
  #     global_paths:
  #       - "~/.claude/CLAUDE.md"
  #       - "~/.config/claude/CLAUDE.md"  # Add custom global path
  #   commands:
  #     dir: ".claude/commands"
  #     extension: ".md"
  #     source_dir: "COMMANDS"
  #     global_paths:
  #       - "~/.claude/commands"

  # Example: Add a custom agent provider
  # myprovider:
  #   name: "myprovider"
  #   display_name: "My Custom Agent"
  #   guideline:
  #     file: "MYPROVIDER.md"
  #     dir: ""
  #     source: "AGENTS.md"
  #     global_paths:
  #       - "~/.myprovider/MYPROVIDER.md"
  #   commands:
  #     dir: ".myprovider/commands"
  #     extension: ".md"
  #     source_dir: "COMMANDS"
  #     global_paths:
  #       - "~/.myprovider/commands"

  # Example: Override Cursor to use a different directory structure
  # cursor:
  #   commands:
  #     dir: ".cursor/custom-commands"  # Use custom directory
  #     extension: ".txt"  # Use .txt instead of .md
